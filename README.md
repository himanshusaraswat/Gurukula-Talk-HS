# How to run the project

The project showcases a simple & easy to understand structure.

 - Just navigate to project root directory & run ***npm i*** in your
   respective terminal.
   
 - Run the command ***tsc*** in your terminal, this    will compile your
   code into the *lib* directory according to the  *tsconfig.json* .
   
 - To execute any code/file just do  a ***node lib/0-event-loop***
   i.e. ***node lib/{ { file-name } }*** to see it in action.
   
Cheers, happy coding :-)
